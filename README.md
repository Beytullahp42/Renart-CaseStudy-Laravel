# Ring Product List Backend (Laravel)

This is the backend application for a full-stack web case study built as part of my internship application for [Renart](https://www.renartglobal.com/). It reads product data from a local JSON file, fetches real-time gold gram prices via [MetalPriceAPI](https://metalpriceapi.com/), and exposes endpoints for listing and filtering products.


---

## ✨ Features

- **Fetch Products** — calculates each product’s dynamic price based on its weight, popularity score, and current gold price
- **Filter Products** — accepts min/max price and popularity (0–5 star scale) and returns matching items
- **Gold Price Endpoint** — returns the current USD gold gram price
- **In-memory Caching** — caches the gold price for 1 hour to minimize external API calls

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Laravel 12**
- **MetalPriceAPI** for live gold prices
